# StoryTeller

https://JimFawcett.github.io/StoryTellerRepo.html

Webpage that manages stories - collection of site pages that are focused on a single theme.

The important files in this repository are:
1. StoryTeller.html - the web application that manages stories
2. CppStory.html - defines the timeline and page notes for C++ Story
3. StoryTest.html - used for construction testing of StoryTeller
4. A.html, B.html, C.html, and D.html are pages for StoryTest
4. StoryList.html - provides links to all available stories, e.g., StoryTest and CppStory

Test are all static pages using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, so you can simply copy the files to your local
machine and run the StoryTeller there.  All of the CppStory pages are loaded from https://JimFawcett.github.io
so you should only need the files cited above to get started.
